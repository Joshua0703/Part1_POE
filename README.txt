The purpose of the program that I developed was with a purpose to assist in the aid of helping users manage and assist in the preparing and making of recipes as well as giving them somewhere to store them

The first thing a user will see is a very simple interface in which the user can interact with the different options and interact with their recipes and manage them accordingly.

In order to compile the application, download the file and open Visual Studio Code. Then you will need to download the C# support extension and .NET code for Microsoft. Then once that is done open the file and run.
